# SChISM: Semantic Clustering via Image Sequence Merging for Images of Human-Decomposition
This program generates clusters each of which depicting the same semantic for images with evolving content. The evolution of the content results in distinct appearance for images depicting the same semantic.
## Requiremnets 
```
Keras 2.1.0
Tensoflow 1.15.2

```
## Run
input_file1 should include the id for all subjects(donors) and input_file2 should include paths to all of the images.
```
bash sequence.sh input_file1 input_file2
```
## Docker
```
docker build . -t <docker_image_name>
docker run --gpus all -it --name <container_name> <docker_image_name> bash
```
